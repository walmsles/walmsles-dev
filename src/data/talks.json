    "description": "Serverless technology is often associated with cloud-native startups, but in this leadership panel discussion, some of the most experienced minds in the industry talk about the business value of serverless technology for enterprises. Our panelists will discuss the benefits of serverless technology, including how it can help your organisation become more agile, reduce costs, and improve scalability. They'll also share their experiences with implementing serverless technology in their own organisations, including any challenges they faced and how they overcame them; the type of knowledge and skillsets needed for serverless-first technologists; and the mindset enterprises need to adopt in order to fully benefit from the serverless paradigm.",
