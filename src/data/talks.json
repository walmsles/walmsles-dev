    "description": "You've built your application, deployed it with ease, and it's humming along. As your user base grows and event volumes soar, soon you see performance bottlenecks, throttling, and chaos. This session prepares you for those invisible barriers. Drawing from our experience using AWS Lambda to build high-scale, event-driven systems, explore a real system failure and hear practical strategies and patterns to help you overcome scalability challenges. Whether you're building greenfield applications or optimizing existing systems, leave this session with the knowledge and confidence to unleash your serverless scalability.",

Through live demos, you'll see why \"vibe coding\" might be holding back your projects - and what comes next.\n\nWalk away with a new perspective on AI pair programming and practical tools to level up your development workflow immediately."

    "description": "AI coding tools are fundamentally changing how we build software. But the dominant approach - \"vibe coding\", where developers make broad, hopeful requests to AI - is creating a new kind of technical debt. You receive code that works, but it's generic, hard to maintain, and lacks your context and standards.\n\nIs there a better way?",

    "description": "Serverless technology is often associated with cloud-native startups, but in this leadership panel discussion, some of the most experienced minds in the industry talk about the business value of serverless technology for enterprises. Our panelists will discuss the benefits of serverless technology, including how it can help your organisation become more agile, reduce costs, and improve scalability. They'll also share their experiences with implementing serverless technology in their own organisations, including any challenges they faced and how they overcame them; the type of knowledge and skillsets needed for serverless-first technologists; and the mindset enterprises need to adopt in order to fully benefit from the serverless paradigm.",
