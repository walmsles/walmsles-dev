      About

      <p>
        I'm a passionate advocate for serverless architectures and cloud-native solutions, 
        specializing in building scalable, event-driven systems on AWS. As an AWS Serverless Hero, 
        I focus on helping teams leverage the power of serverless technologies to build better 
        applications faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work centers around AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, EventBridge, and the broader 
        serverless ecosystem. I believe in sharing knowledge through blog posts, workshops, and 
        conference talks to help the community embrace modern cloud architectures.
