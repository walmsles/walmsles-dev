      About
    </h2>
    <div class="space-y-4 text-text">
      <p>
        I'm a passionate advocate for serverless architectures and cloud-native solutions, 
        specializing in building scalable, event-driven systems on AWS. As an AWS Serverless Hero, 
        I focus on helping teams leverage the power of serverless technologies to build better 
        applications faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work centers around AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, EventBridge, and the broader 
        serverless ecosystem. I'm also deeply involved in Agentic AI and leveraging Large Language 
        Models (LLMs) to build intelligent, autonomous systems that enhance application capabilities 
        and user experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe in sharing knowledge through blog posts, workshops, and conference talks to help 
        the community embrace modern cloud architectures and AI-driven solutions.
